In November 2023, Elon Musk sparked significant controversy by endorsing an X post that was widely condemned as anti-semitic. The incident occurred when Musk responded "You have said the actual truth" to a post that was criticized for promoting anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.

The endorsement led to immediate and widespread backlash from civil rights organizations, public figures, and advertisers. Many major companies suspended their advertising on X in response to the controversy, citing concerns about the platform's content moderation and leadership.

The incident raised serious questions about platform leadership responsibility, content moderation policies, and the role of social media executives in combating hate speech. The controversy had significant financial implications for X Corp through advertiser boycotts and damaged the platform's reputation.
