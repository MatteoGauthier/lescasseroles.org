Tesla's Autopilot system has been the subject of intense scrutiny following multiple fatal accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has documented at least 13 fatal crashes involving the system, leading to extensive investigations into the technology's safety and reliability.

The controversy has escalated with recent investigations covering 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving software. These investigations have revealed potential design flaws and raised questions about the system's marketing and deployment.

The incidents have sparked debate about the readiness of autonomous driving technology for public roads and Tesla's approach to testing and deploying such systems. The controversy has significant implications for the future of autonomous vehicle development and regulation.
