Since Elon Musk's acquisition of X (formerly Twitter) in October 2022, the platform has experienced a significant increase in hate speech content. Research from the University of California, Berkeley has documented a 50% rise in hate speech, raising serious concerns about content moderation and platform safety.

The study's findings have been corroborated by multiple academic sources, showing that this increase has been sustained over time, particularly in the first eight months following the acquisition. This trend has major implications for user safety, platform integrity, and the broader social media landscape.

The controversy highlights the challenges of balancing free speech with content moderation, and the impact of leadership changes on social media platform policies. The significant increase in hate speech has led to advertiser concerns and public debate about the platform's direction under Musk's leadership.
